# Scandium
A high performance machine learning library written in c \\

This project is a work in progress and something I do alone in my free time,
there may be bugs and it may not work on your specific machine/OS

## Elements
- linalg: a linear algebra library for tensors and vectors
- scandium engine: a execution engine supporting multi threading, SIMD instructions, and batch operations

## WIP
- implement tensor operations
- implement SIMD supports
- migrate all vector operations to the scandium engine


## TODO
- implement linear regression
- implement logistic regression
- implement neural networks with a modular architecture
